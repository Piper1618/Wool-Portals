# Wool Portals

A Minecraft data pack that adds the ability to create wool portals, linking any two portals of the same color.

To create a portal, place nine wool blocks of the same color in a horizontal 3x3 area. Place an iron or gold block above the middle wool block. Light the top of the metal block on fire to activate the portal. The metal block is consumed when activating the portal.

Any previously existing portals with the same wool color and metal type will be deactivated. There can only ever be two active portals of the same wool color: one made with iron and the other with gold. The portals may be in the same dimension or different dimensions.

Once two active portals of the same wool color exist in the world, stand on either one to be teleported to the other.

Compatible with Minecraft 1.19.4 (known to fail in 1.19.3 and below).

Dependent on my [Teleport Scoreboard](https://github.com/Piper1618/Teleport-Scoreboard) data pack.
